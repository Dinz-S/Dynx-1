## How to run locally

1. Download or clone the repo.  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser — no server required.  
   Or, for live-reload during development use VS Code + Live Server extension.

```bash
# optional if you use git locally
git clone https://github.com/Dinz-S/Dynx-1.git
cd Dynx-1
# open index.html in your browser
